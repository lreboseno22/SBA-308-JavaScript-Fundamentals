# SBA 308 - JavaScript Fundamentals


## Reflection:
1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
   - I could have taken more time to really understand all the information given because there were moments in which I got lost when   getting an assignments id so I think taking the time necessary to really understand the objects and how they relate to one another in a much more deeper level.
