# SBA 308 - JavaScript Fundamentals


## Reflection:
1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
   - I could have taken more time to really understand all the information given because there were moments in which I got lost when   getting an assignments id so I think taking the time necessary to really understand the objects and how they relate to one another in a much more deeper level.

2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
   - I've never used try and catch before so I wrapped my main function logic inside it at the final but it wasn't too difficult. I think if I keep implementing it into my projects I'll get more used to it.

3. What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
   - I believe there could be less code but I'm not excatly sure how to shorten it and I feel like I would change how cluttered my code looks.
